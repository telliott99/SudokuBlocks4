Conversion to Swift4 seems to work OK

issues:

Do Convert -> ToCurrentSwiftSyntax
(minimize inference), @objc stuff...

results:

NSAlertStyle 
is now
NSAlert.Style

NSAlertFirstButtonReturn
is now
NSApplication.ModalResponse.alertFirstButtonReturn

NSOnState 
is now
NSControl.StateValue.on

NSApplication.shared().delegate
is now
NSApplication.shared.delegate

NSBezierPath.setDefaultLineWidth(2)
is now
NSBezierPath.defaultLineWidth = 2

-----------

MainWindowController(windowNibName: NSNib.Name(rawValue: "MainWindowController"))


windowNibName: NSNib.Name? {
    return NSNib.Name(rawValue: "TextWindowController")}

Also EnableRecommendedWarnings

Clean and Build and get some errors:

2 windowNibName changes did not get made

NSOnState 
is
NSControl.StateValue.on

Clean and Build and get some more:
completionHandler: { (result: Int) ->
is now
NSApplication.ModalResponse not Int

so just below I need
result.rawValue

Also substring is deprecated

let i = current.index(current.startIndex, offsetBy: n)
let front = current.substring(to: i)
ret.append(front)
current = current.substring(from: i)

is now

let i = current.startIndex
let j = current.index(i, offsetBy: n-1)
let k = current.index(i, offsetBy: n)

let front = String(current[i...j])
ret.append(front)
current = String(current[k...])

-----------

At this point, the app does run.

finally:

may need to add @objc
may need to fix deprecated implicit @objc reference  (how?)

in Build settings:
set Swift 3 @objc inference to Default
